# Cubes
This script uses graphics.py, a module written by Rance D. Necaise, to draw
three dimensional cubes using arguments given by the user. This script
currently accepts three arguments that it uses to determine the size of the
cube. Arguments should be passed in the order Width (x) Height (y) Depth(z)
ie: cubes.py 200 300 400 would create a cube with a width of 200 pixels,
a height of 300 pixels, and a depth of 400 pixels.
